    "    - `from .models import modelName`\n",
    "  2. Inside our index function we created for the mini-app, we can use the following types of commands:\n",
    "      - **Get All Method**: `modelName.objects.all()` - This gets all of a model's objects from our database.\n",

    "        - Example: A Movie model and we want to only get the movies released in 1948, we would use the code: `Movie.objects.filter(release_date = 1948)`\n",
    "      - **Get Single Object Method**: `modelsName.objects.get(attribute=xxx)` <- This will get a single item from the database. \n",
    "        - Example: A Movie model and we want to only get the movie that is named \"Meet the Robinsons\", we would use the code: `Movie.objects.get(title=\"Meet the Robinsons)`\n",
    "      - We also have methods for saving and deleting objects from our database, look them up if you want to use them.\n",
    "  2a. Set the method you decide to use to a variableName and then use a list comprehension to get all of a certain attribute of your model's items and that returns a list that you can use a join function on to make the list of movies into a string and set that to a variable.\n",
    "  3. Change the return statement in the index function to the variable you created with the join function.\n",

    "- You get an automatic homepage on your main app with django until you add your first additional path. Once you do that, you will no longer have a main homepage view.\n",
    "- To make a homepage, do the following:\n",
    "  1. In the main app directory, add a new file named `views.py`.\n",
    "  2. In the views.py of your main app directory, import the following import statement to use the render function.\n",
    "    - `from django.shortcuts import render`\n",
    "  3. Define a new views funtion named home with one parameter named request, so the format is:\n",
    "    - `def home(requests)`\n",
    "  4. Then we simply render a template and return it. \n",
    "  The format will be:\n",
    "    - `return render(request, 'home.html')`\n",
    "      - The two parameters are:\n",
    "        - The request paramter from the function definition.\n",
    "        - The name of the template we are going to use for this path.\n",
    "  5. Then we need to register our new view in the main apps directory, in the `urls.py` file.\n",
    "  6.  In the urls.py of your main app directory, import the following import statement to use the view we created.\n",
    "    - `from . import views`\n",
    "  7. Now create a new path in the `urlpatterns` list with the following format:\n",
    "    - `path('',views.home)`\n",
    "  8. Finally we need to creat the template. To do this, go to the templates folder of the main project and create a file named `home.html`.\n",
    "  9. In the new `home.html` file, extend our base.html using the following format:\n",
    "    - `{% extends 'base.html' %}`\n",
    "  10. Then we need to create a block with the following format:\n",
    "    - `{% block content %}`\n",
    "        HOME PAGE HTML CODE\n",
    "    - `{% endblock %}`"
